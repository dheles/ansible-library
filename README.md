# ansible-library
library of stuff i'm tinkering with while learning [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

these are notes, experiments, etc. for my own edification and future development. here at the outset, at least, they are largely based on examples from Guy Geerling's [Ansible for DevOps](http://ansiblefordevops.com/). as such, before using any of this, you might want to double-check his examples, which are better informed, reviewed, tested, etc. they can be found in his repos on GitHub - [specific to the book](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops) and [pertaining to ansible and vagrant](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-vagrant-examples)

## license
as i'm not presenting any of this as finished work, i see no reason to put it under any particular license. Guy's stuff (for the book, at least), is under MIT license. therefore, any "copies or substantial portions of [his] Software" herein should receive a copy of his [license](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops/blob/master/LICENSE). i will endeavor to not forget to include it where appropriate.
