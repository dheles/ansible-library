# Drupal LAMP server
[official repo](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops/tree/master/drupal)

from Jeff Geerling's [Ansible for DevOps](http://ansiblefordevops.com/), with some additional monkeying about by myself.

...most notably, I was unable to get Ubuntu to work, so I adapted the project to run on Debian. While I've attempted to retain compatibility with Ubuntu, I'm unable to test at this time. At any rate, you'd probably be better off with Guy's version. Also, while I'm dragging around a master Vagrant file that implies this project can run on Centos, that is not true. At least not yet.
