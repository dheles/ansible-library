# solr server using roles from Ansible galaxy

from Jeff Geerling's [Ansible for DevOps](http://ansiblefordevops.com/), with some additional monkeying about by myself.

## NOTE: this is not working at present.
apparently the apt tomcat6 package is no longer available (at least not to current versions of Ubuntu or Debian). Centos7 isn't cooperating either, though I'm less certain of the reason why.
